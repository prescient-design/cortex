# A Modular Architecture for Deep Learning Systems

## Notice: Alpha Release
This is an alpha release. The API is subject to change and the documentation is incomplete.

## What is `cortex`?

The `cortex` library provides a modular framework for neural network model composition for advanced use cases like multitask models, guided generative models, and multi-modal models.
Rather than tack on auxiliary abstractions to a single input --> single task model, `cortex` is built from the ground up to make adding new inputs or tasks to the model as seamless as possible.


## Installation

```bash
conda create --name cortex-env python=3.10 -y && conda activate cortex-env
python -m pip install -r requirements.in
pip install -e .
```


If you have a package version issue we provide pinned versions of all dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
To update the frozen dependencies run

```bash
pip-compile --resolver=backtracking requirements.in
```


## Running

Use `cortex_train_model --config-name <CONFIG_NAME>` to train, e.g.:

```bash
cortex_train_model --config-name train_protein_model wandb_mode=offline
```


## How to launch a WANDB sweep

1. Configure the sweep `.yaml`, e.g. `./config/wandb/protein_model_sweep.yaml`
2. Run `wandb sweep ./config/wandb/protein_model_sweep.yaml`
3. Launch the wandb agents using a scheduler of your choice, e.g. SLURM or LSF


## Contributing

## What's in the name?

The cerebral cortex is the outer layer of the brain (i.e. the grey matter). Different parts of the cortex are responsible for different functions, including sensation, motor function, and reasoning. The cortex is supported and interconnected by subcortical structures (i.e. the white matter). Similarly the `cortex` package provides modular neural network components for different functions, such as extracting features from different types of inputs, or making predictions for different tasks.
`cortex` also provides a flexible superstructure to compose those modules into advanced architectures and route signals between them.
